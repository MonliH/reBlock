reBlock is a web application that uses deep learning to block sponsor segments in YouTube videos. Whereas traditional ad blockers (e.g. uBlock Origin) only skip ads that YouTube puts in videos, reBlock detects sponsored segments in real time and skips them.

Submitted to the [Hack3](https://devpost.com/software/reblock-xjgkrb) hackathon, winning **first place**.

Was trained on [sponsorblock](https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock) public data. Thanks to the creators for publicly releasing it!
