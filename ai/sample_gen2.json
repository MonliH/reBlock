[{"sponsor": false, "phrase": "[Music] all right you right to grab the back end uh well not not at the moment yeah not yet so you lock him in the scratch from this species will knock you knock you down could kill you or oh definitely yeah okay so i am back in australia and of course i'm reminded that everything in this country is trying to kill you particularly snakes and spiders and here at the australian reptile park they actually milk snakes and spiders so they can use their venom to make anti-venom and save lives let's go see how they do it all right so come on in man this is without a doubt the most dangerous room in the country you're currently surrounded floor-to-ceiling with venomous snakes and the only thing that keeps the snakes in is those little locks yeah just the little locks in the thin glass did a snake actually do that yeah yeah so a kid was tapping on the glass i told him not to his parents like nah it's all good and i'm like don't tap on the glass man the snake goes kid ran out of the uh smelling of uh crap so yeah for real yeah oh yeah he went and went screaming out the room in australia we lose one to three people per annum to snakebite internationally estimates by the world health organization is 120 000. so not only do we have some of the best antivirus products anywhere on the planet but we have a federally funded anti-venom program which means no matter who you are you get anti-venom for free so we'll probably play with a big coastal taipan to start with yeah and uh so why why are we starting big oh might as well you tell me what i need to do right here i'm just going to grab a vault from behind you because obviously we use only the most highly scientific pieces of equipment here at the reptile park got it it's our shot glass beautiful and uh i might even get you to hold that for me a second this is one of our big boys hopefully he's in a good mood as you can see quite a large individual wow now what we're going to do yeah is pin him now wait wait wait give him up there you go you hold that i'll take that vial off okay this feels absurd there"}, {"sponsor": false, "phrase": "go as you can see he's keen on the killing now snakes aren't stupid he doesn't want to bite the jar he wants to bite me fingers the target [Music] there we go oh my goodness that was a lot of venom delivered very quickly yeah they're not mocking around wow now what we'll do is we'll actually give his venom glaze a little bit of a massage so what you would consider is cheeks give them a little bit of a roll see if we can get an extra drop or two because every drop matters now because my hand's starting to cramp up i'm going to put him away so i'll get you guys to jump back for me and this is the sketchy bit yeah when you get him out you got the hook when you're putting him back it's just who's quicker ready your hands trembling a bit yeah yeah every time so how much venom do you actually need to make anti-venom about 15 15 snakes to make one vial of any of that venom evolved from saliva and it's used primarily for catching and digesting prey each species of snake has a different venom tailored to the specific animals they hunt the venom was originally squirted into a snake's mouth by the back teeth and to this day almost two-thirds of all snakes are rear fanged now why the rear tooth you might ask well it's because the venom gland itself is actually behind the snake's eye so the shortest distance for a duct is directly downwards to the back end of the top jaw in some species evolutionary pressures caused the fangs to move closer and closer to the front of the jaw improving the snake's ability to catch and kill prey while the location of the fangs was evolving so were the fangs themselves they started off as smooth ordinary teeth with venom flowing down the outside but over time some snake lineages evolved a groove in each fang to channel the flow of venom in some species the groove became deeper and deeper eventually closing in to form a hollow tube and now the teeth literally inject venom into prey but this is not the norm only one-seventh of the world's snakes have hollow fangs but of course almost all the"}, {"sponsor": false, "phrase": "snakes in australia do have hollow fangs so we set up this macro shot to take a closer look this one's rolling that one's rolling we're ready when you're uh perfect all right everyone's ready [Music] wow it's got like jets jets of venom coming out has this guy not been milked in a while or yeah it's been a little while [Music] not only do we have some of the most toxic snakes in the planet here uh we also selectively breed them for the production of anti-venom they're bred to produce more venom than their wild counterparts so some of our coastal tyre pens are producing six nearly seven times what their wild counterpart would and that's just from selective breeding you find your two most psychotic ones you put them together you hope for the best and the absolute worst comes out so uh keeps you on your toes that sounds horrendous so you're saying that these are the most venomous snakes in the world and then you have bred them to be more venomous yeah they're super snakes a scratch from any of these animals could kill you and uh some of these snakes giving four and a half 4.9 grams of venom per bite which is just stupid amounts we spoke to venom expert timothy jackson who argued these snakes produce more venom because they are regularly milked unlike wild snakes either way the snakes in this room contain more venom than virtually any others on earth we house the second the third the fourth the fifth and about the twelfth or thirteenth most toxic depending on who you talk to one bite from a king cobra contains enough venom to kill thirteen thousand mice and we know this because of a study from 1979 that tested the venoms of 25 different species of snake on lab mice from this we can estimate that the venom from one king cobra bite could kill around four humans though to be precise we'd have to say four human-sized rodents because thankfully no one's tested these venoms on humans and by this measure the most venomous snake in the world is the inland taipan which conveniently lives in the middle of australia a bite from the inland taipan has enough venom to"}, {"sponsor": false, "phrase": "half a million mice or more than a hundred humans so yeah why not milk that one next so the next one we're gonna step it up another notch so this is the inland taipan also known as the fierce snake the most toxic land snake on the planet these guys have the ability with one drop of venom to knock over 100 adult humans so stupidly toxic so quite a lot smaller than the last couple of animals we've used but makes up for it in toxicity very very quick and very naughty when he wants to be but an absolutely gorgeous pattern you can grab that bit for me mate yes i'm gonna grab this vial from behind you and as you can see he's very keen on the killing there we go that is extraordinary the most venomous snake in the world [Music] just incredible animals aren't there that was quick yeah those ones make me proper nervous i don't know about you guys but can i see the hands the moment i stopped doing that after a milking is the day i quit the concept of the most venomous snake is complicated because snakes evolved their venom specifically for potency against their usual prey in turn their prey evolved resistance to their venom the honey badger for example is almost completely immune to cobra venom so the lethality of a bite depends on the snake the animal that got bitten and the amount of venom injected the reason scientists test different venoms on lab mice is to get an estimate of the amount of antivenom that would be required to neutralize a bite snake venom is lethal to us because we are closely related to snake's main prey rodents rodents and primates split on the evolutionary tree only 75 million years ago so we share a lot of the same biology from the structure of our cells to the way our blood clots to how our nerves send signals venoms typically target very conserved molecular pathways that exist across maybe all vertebrates or maybe even the entire tree of life in in some cases there are four ways that snake venom can kill you it can be neurotoxic damaging to your nervous system and brain by interfering with neurotransmitters the signaling chemicals that go between"}, {"sponsor": false, "phrase": "it can be hemotoxic thinning out your blood preventing wounds from healing and causing internal bleeding it does this by disturbing the delicate machinery of the blood coagulation system venom can also be cytotoxic attacking cells leading to severe blisters necrosis and cell death it can also be myotoxic destroying muscles and causing paralysis the worst part is that snake venoms can contain up to 200 compounds most venoms contain a combination of neurotoxic hemotoxic cytotoxic and myotoxic proteins this is what makes snake bites so difficult to treat it's not just one toxin you're trying to neutralize but dozens all working together to try to kill you one more good boy there we go i've been at the park for 10 years this year uh i've been running this facility for uh seven and a half eight have you ever been bitten um yeah so uh about three and a half years ago i got a scratch um one finger got nicked that was 36 hours in icu and eight of those are on a recess bay so very very serious and what was that experience like that that was crappy as it turns out i'm highly allergic to antivenom which is not ideal i started swelling up looking like the elephant man so then they whack you with the adrenaline to cancel out the anaphylaxis and then they have to give you more anti-venom more adrenaline more anti-venom more adrenaline more antimatter more adrenaline and thankfully you only needed the one but it was like the best case scenario so we didn't chew we didn't buy it but literally just just a scratch so what is anti-venom exactly and how was it invented in 1870 a british military doctor edward nicholson was stationed in burma and as he watched the local snake handlers he noticed something strange they would from time to time deliberately get cobras to bite them in what he considered a form of tattooing nicholson reasoned that they were intentionally exposing their bodies to the venom to develop an immune response he observed that the older snake handlers were less affected by accidental bites than the younger ones so this dangerous practice"}, {"sponsor": false, "phrase": "to be paying off 20 years later in saigon a french medical researcher named albert calmet was vaccinating local residents against smallpox when he became aware of the threat posed by cobras he wondered if it was possible to make a vaccine for snakebites back in paris he tried injecting rabbits with a tiny amount of cobra venom starting with just .03 milligrams but each week he injected the rabbits again slowly increasing the dose and after eight months of this the rabbits were receiving 35 milligrams of cobra venom at a time that is 15 times the normal lethal dose in rabbits but they were still perfectly healthy the rabbit's immune systems had developed antibodies to neutralize the venom so you can be vaccinated against snake bites just as you can against disease but who wants to be vaccinated against all different types of snakes just in case one bites you it would be better calnet reasoned if you could administer antibodies after a bite so he drew blood from a venom resistant rabbit and isolated the serum which contains the antibodies and then he injected it into another rabbit that had never been exposed to venom when he subsequently injected it with twice the lethal dose of cobra venom the rabbit was just fine immunity had been transferred from one rabbit to another this was the first anti-venom or as the frenchman khalnet called it antivenin which is why my phone always makes that auto correction to this day anti-venoms are made in much the same way at the reptile park they collect and freeze the venom it's sent off to be diluted and injected into a donor animal usually a horse horses are used because of their size after increasing the dose over a period of months the horse builds up immunity to the venom and then its blood is drawn and the antibodies are isolated only the plasma is taken the red blood cells are returned to the horse those horse antibodies are the life-saving antivenom anti-venom works for the same reason venom works because of our shared evolutionary history with other mammals the antibodies produced by horses are very similar to the ones produced by"}, {"sponsor": false, "phrase": "so they bind to toxic compounds and neutralize them even in our bodies but this way of making anti-venom has downsides collecting the venom is dangerous many donor animals are involved and some people are allergic to antivenom scientists are now exploring the possibility of producing antivenom using genetically modified bacteria they would produce the specific antibodies needed to neutralize each toxin in a venom but for now this is the way anti-venom is made how's your arm it's a bit sore the shoulder's a bit tender the work zach and others like him do saves countless lives all around the world if you're up here for fame and fortune and oh look how tough i am milking snakes you don't last long you get chewed on and you go oh this is not for me if you're up here because you love the animals and this is an opportunity to not only work with the animals you love but to actively be a part of saving lives like i'm not smart enough to be a doctor i'll just put that out there straight away but i can swing a snake pretty good hey"}, {"sponsor": true, "phrase": " milking snakes is a very hands-on activity and so is learning with this video
